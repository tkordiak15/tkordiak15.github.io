## [Building a Project Website]{.underline}

In the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science.

-   In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages
-   Includes a github repo for access to all the code

## [Precipitation Data Collection Project]{.underline}

In Spring of 2024 I took a Geospatial Science class that was based in ArcGIS Pro where I gained useful mapping skills

-   In this project we were to create a map with a legend and locator map of the numerous precipitation gauges at the Colorado State University, Mountain Campus

-   Includes a map graphic which visualizes the result of the analysis, along with amounts of precipitation during the 2023 Summer Session

-   Here there is a snapshot of the completed layout in which the map was designed

## [Integrated Mosquito Management Trifold Project]{.underline}

I took an internship course in the Summer of 2024 to fulfill my required credits to graduate and did my internship through a mosquito control company called Vector Disease Control International in Loveland, Colorado. As my last assignment I was to create a trifold to inform my professor what I did over the course of my internship.

-   In this project I created a mock informational trifold which highlights what mosquito surveillence is and how to prevent West Nile Virus

-   Includes images of the traps used to capture adult mosquitos, ways to prevent bites, West Nile carrier species numbers through the years, and what happens after we capture the mosquitos

-   Here is the trifold that was created using Canva
